# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
Using Multi-Class classification to identify handwritten digits .
This is an assignment for Andrew NG course for machine learning. In this assignment we should use multi-class classification to predict the corresponding digit of an image of a handwritten digit. Each image is a 20by20 pixel image. The input data include 5000 training examples with information of gray scale intensity of each pixel for these 20*20 pixel image. The input data is named "Digits_Data.m" which is matlab array with size of 5000*400.
"Main_File.m" is where we load the input data, call our functions, predict each example's corresponding digit and finally investigate the accuracy of our prediction.
