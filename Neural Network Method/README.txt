# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
Training a Neural Network to identify handwritten digits .
This is an assignment for Andrew NG course for machine learning. In this assignment we should train a neural network with one hidden layer with 26 units to predict the corresponding digit of an image of a handwritten digit. Each image is a 20by20 pixel image. The input data include 5000 training examples with information of gray scale intensity of each pixel for these 20by20 pixel image. The input data is named "Traning_Set.m" which is matlab array with size of 5000by400.
"Main_File.m" is where we load the input data, call our functions, predict each example's corresponding digit and finally investigate the accuracy of our prediction.
